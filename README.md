# Banking-System
A command line application that replicates embedded software of ATMs at banks. 
The Banking System application allows users to perform the following operations with the bank:
  * register an account
  * close an account
  * check account balance
  * deposit into account
  * withdraw from account
  * show list of all users registered with the bank
The application interacts with a text file called "users.txt" to store user's information; hence simulating the database 
for a bank.
